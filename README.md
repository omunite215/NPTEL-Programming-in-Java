# How to use this Repository?
### This Repository is for Reference.
### This Repository has all the solutions of NPTEL Weekly Assignments. Just Click on Branches and select the week number.
### Each Branch has readme file where you will find all the questions.
### The top most comment is the problem statement to understand the problem and code together.
### Explanation of code has been done through comments wherever neccessary.

# Tips for Assignment and Exam :-
### - Every assignment has testcase so your code must need to pass all the testcases to get marks in assignment.
### - Dont Write customized print statements because showing your creativity will simply mark zero. I got Zero in few assignments not because output was wrong but wrote long print statements before outputs.
### - Prepare basics well before going into Exam.
