## [WEEK 10](https://github.com/omunite215/NPTEL-Programming-in-Java-Ultimate-Guide/tree/WEEK-10)

  [Java Week 10:Q1](https://github.com/omunite215/NPTEL-Programming-in-Java-Ultimate-Guide/blob/WEEK-10/Week10Assignment1.java) The following code needs some package to work properly. Write appropriate code to import the required package(s) in order to make the program compile and execute successfully.

  [Java Week 10:Q2](https://github.com/omunite215/NPTEL-Programming-in-Java-Ultimate-Guide/blob/WEEK-10/Week10Assignment2.java) Write the JDBC codes needed to create a Connection interface using the DriverManager class and the variable DB_URL.  Check whether the connection is successful using 'isAlive(timeout)' method to generate the output, which is either 'true' or 'false'.
```text
Note the following points carefully:
1. Name the connection object as 'conn' only.
2. Use timeout value as 1.
```

  [Java Week 10:Q3](https://github.com/omunite215/NPTEL-Programming-in-Java-Ultimate-Guide/blob/WEEK-10/Week10Assignment3.java) Due to some mistakes in the below code, the code is not compiled/executable. Modify and debug the JDBC code to make it execute successfully.
