# Tips for Assignment and Exam :-
### - Every assignment has testcase so your code must need to pass all the testcases to get marks in assignment.
### - Dont Write customized print statements because showing your creativity will simply mark zero. I got Zero in few assignments not because output was wrong but wrote long print statements before outputs.
### - Prepare basics well before going into Exam.
